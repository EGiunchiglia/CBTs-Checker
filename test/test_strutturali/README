STRUCTURAL TESTING ORGANIZATION:

Since the code follows a precise pipeline, and it cannot
procede to the next step if the preceding one is not successful
we can conduct the structural testing in the following way:
we start from the first stage of the pipeline (a function)
and we test if it works correctly. Once done that, we take the
case in which the first stage is successful and we test the second stage
in those cases in which the previous one is successful. We can
then continue until we reach the end of the pipeline.

In this way we can reach the 100% Branch Coverage (of course this does not 
cover the internal implementation of Limboole).

For each stage of the pipeline there is a file .cpp called with
the name of the considered stage and a folder containing all the
necessary inputs for that stage.

Stages:
1) read XML file
2) compute the sequence length of each node
3) create the state graph
4) create the CBT plans representation
5) compute a model of the representation and derive the initial requirements
